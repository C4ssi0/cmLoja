Good morning, good afternoon and good night!

Today I'm bringing for the first time a very simple store plugin for Minecraft servers.

The cmLoja consists of creating stores using signs, such as the ChestShop plugin.

Both staff and players can create stores, so just have the permissions!


✦ Test the versions: 1.13x, 1.12x, 1.11x, 1.10x, 1.9x, 1.8x


✦ Plugin Video: https://youtu.be/Dklc07uynfg

✦ Commands: /geraritem

➤ Generates some custom item to add on sale using the sign.

✦ Permissions ✦

loja.geraritem: Permission to use the /geraritem command

loja.admin: Permission for admin to create store of all kinds.

loja.player: Permission for the player to create store using the chest.

loja.quebrarloja: Permission for the player to be able to break any Vip store.

loja.abrirbau: Permission for the player to be able to open the chest of any VIP store.

✦ VIP Discount ✦

➤ loja.vender.0-100: Permission to give "discount" in the store, that is, the player will sell more expensive items only in the server store. The values can be from 0 to 100 per cent.

➤ loja.comprar.0-100: Permission to discount the store when buying any items in the server store.

➤ Example: loja.comprar.10 <- The player will have 10% discount on the server store.

➤ ADMINS DO NOT HAVE DISCOUNTS IN SHOP, THAT IS, NO OF THE 2 PERMISSIONS WILL WORK.
